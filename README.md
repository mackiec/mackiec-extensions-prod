# üõçÔ∏è Shopify Checkout Extensions Collection

This is a personal project that combines multiple Shopify Checkout Extensions into a single app. Some are simple boilerplate code (e.g., a custom banner), while others are more feature-rich (e.g., a multi-sectioned checkbox section that expands content and can block checkout progress).

## üöÄ Getting Started

Clone this repo and modify the extensions as desired to fit any custom use cases.

### üìã Prerequisites

1. You must [download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if you don't already have it.
2. You should [create a Shopify partner account](https://partners.shopify.com/signup) if you don't have one.
3. You should create a store for testing if you don't have one, either a [development store](https://help.shopify.com/en/partners/dashboard/development-stores#create-a-development-store) or a [Shopify Plus sandbox store](https://help.shopify.com/en/partners/dashboard/managing-stores/plus-sandbox-store).

### üíª Local Development

[The Shopify CLI](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/tools/cli) connects to an app in your Partners dashboard. It provides environment variables and runs commands in parallel.

You can develop locally using your preferred package manager. Run one of the following commands from the root of your app:

Using yarn:
```shell
yarn dev
```

Using npm:
```shell
npm run dev
```

Using pnpm:
```shell
pnpm run dev
```

Open the URL generated in your console. Once you grant permission to the app, you can start development.

3. Use the Shopify CLI to test your changes locally

### Creating New Extensions

1. Use the Shopify CLI to generate a new extension:
   ```shell
   npm run generate
   ```
2. Select the appropriate extension type
3. Implement your extension logic
4. Add the extension to your app's configuration

### Best Practices

- Keep UI extensions focused on a single purpose
- Use metafields for storing extension data
- Follow Shopify's design guidelines for a consistent checkout experience
- Test extensions thoroughly with different cart configurations

## üì§ Deployment

To deploy your app with its extensions to a Shopify store:

```shell

```

This will build your extensions and deploy them to your Shopify Partners account. You can then install the app on your development or production store.
